## üéØ Understanding Research Results

### Global Overview
- **Total countries analyzed**
- **Global average intake levels**
- **Highest and lowest risk regions**
- **Risk distribution across populations**

### Country Risk Analysis
- **Risk Level Classification**:
  - üü¢ **Low Risk**: <400 total particles/gram
  - üü° **Moderate Risk**: 400-800 particles/gram
  - üî¥ **High Risk**: >800 particles/gram

### Population Clusters
The system identifies three main population groups:
- **Low Risk Population**: Countries with minimal exposure across all sources
- **Moderate Risk Population**: Countries requiring targeted interventions
- **High Risk Population**: Countries needing urgent comprehensive action

### Food Source Analysis
- **Global averages** for each food source
- **Range of exposure** (min-max across countries)
- **Countries at risk** for each food source
- **Recommended interventions** by food source

## üí° Policy Recommendations

### High Risk Countries
- **Policy**: Implement strict regulations on plastic waste management
- **Public Health**: Launch nationwide awareness campaigns
- **Individual**: Prioritize filtered water access and fresh food programs

### Moderate Risk Countries  
- **Policy**: Strengthen environmental monitoring and recycling programs
- **Public Health**: Educate consumers about safer food choices
- **Individual**: Promote local, sustainable food systems

### Low Risk Countries
- **Policy**: Maintain current protections and continue monitoring
- **Public Health**: Share best practices with higher-risk regions
- **Individual**: Continue sustainable practices and support global initiatives

## üî¨ The Science Behind It

### Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. **K-Means Clustering**: Groups countries by similar exposure patterns
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Visualizes complex global patterns
3. **Association Rules (Apriori)**: Identifies which food sources correlate globally

### Research Applications:
- **Epidemiological Studies**: Population exposure assessment
- **Environmental Health**: Global contamination patterns
- **Policy Development**: Evidence-based intervention strategies
- **Risk Assessment**: Comparative analysis across regions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With:
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript

### Analysis Features:
- **Multi-country comparison** with statistical analysis
- **Risk stratification** based on research thresholds
- **Pattern recognition** for global trends
- **Policy recommendation engine** based on risk levels
